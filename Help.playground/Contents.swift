// this lab focuses on how methods are called like functions, except you put the constant or variable you are call on them before the method name, followed by a dot, and then the name of the method. Arguments to the method are supplied the same way they are when you call functions: By placing them in parentheses after the method name. For now, just think of a method as a function. You'll learn a lot more about methods in a later lesson.
